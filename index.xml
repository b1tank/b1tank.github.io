It&amp;rsquo;s been a long long time since my first init post in this blog site. Now I have sort of decided what I&amp;rsquo;m gonna post in my blog (plus what I&amp;rsquo;m gonna do offline).
What I&amp;rsquo;m gonna post (for everyone to learn) I have been a fan of the one-and-only Scott Hanselman for some time and he shares the same interest in cloud business as I have.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>http://b1tank.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2021 23:38:13 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://b1tank.github.io/about/</guid><description>I am a basketball and a billards/pool fan and amateur player (you can find out which team I like in my blog), a software engineer working in a cloud business (which I will unfold in my blog), and a former data scientist with a chemical engineering doctoral degree (Ph.D.).
I like sharing some thoughts on both non-tech and tech stuff.</description></item><item><title>Init Post</title><link>http://b1tank.github.io/post/2021/01/18/init-post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2021 23:34:13 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://b1tank.github.io/post/2021/01/18/init-post/</guid><description>Finally, I got my first post here, after witnessing Warriors' stunning comebacks against 2 LA championship calibre contenders (today marks the MLK day&amp;rsquo;s showdown between @StephenCurry30 and @KingJames) and scrapping through a whole bunch of hassles for building this Hugo-powered blog.
I have already thought of jotting down that Steph&amp;rsquo;s quote &amp;ldquo;You try to just continue to stay humble and stay in the moment. That&amp;rsquo;s the best way to approach it&amp;rdquo; after the vintage Warriors' comeback against the Clippers on Jan 8, 2021.</description></item></channel></rss>
