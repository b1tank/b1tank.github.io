Now I have sort of decided what I&rsquo;m gonna post in my blog (plus what I&rsquo;m gonna do offline).</p><h2 id=what-im-gonna-post-for-everyone-to-learn>What I&rsquo;m gonna post (for everyone to learn)</h2><p>I have been a fan of the one-and-only <a href=https://www.hanselman.com/>Scott Hanselman</a> for some time and he shares the same interest in cloud business as I have. His <a href=https://www.hanselman.com/blog>blog</a>, <a href=http://twitter.com/shanselman>twitter</a>, <a href=http://www.hanselminutes.com/>podcast</a>, even lately newly-released <a href=https://www.tiktok.com/@shanselman>TikTok</a> really share the same magic attraction to the general community, i.e. audience-friendly. More specifically, the reason why people follow those materials is that they are well communicated and easily intepreted (of course he is such a fun!). By learning from all sorts of those tech stuff every single day, I start thinking that the major distinction between learning about computer technology and other domains is that tech stuff is sometimes hard to grasp. The deep cause of that is that tech is mostly digital, and there are layers of abstraction from the physical world. Apparently, things in physical world are more comprehensable to most individuals, including myself. I stepped into tech domain from an engineering domain in physical world. When I was a chemical engineering PhD student, I dealt with all sorts of tangible physical stuff ranging from tubes and nuts, polluted air and contaminated water, to lab-scale furnace and factory-scale boilers. For those stuff, it is not that hard to learn compared to those diverse terms in tech world. However, in tech world, even though there are some well-crafted introductions, tutorials or videos, there is usually some non-negligible gap hindering the general public and professionals like myself.</p><p>Actually I have promised my parents who have little tech domain knowledge to explain my work to them once I&rsquo;m ready, and at least I could not explain it well on my first day of my current tech job. I thought about this issue and why it is an issue from the beginning for a long time. One indicator is that even explaining what &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; is seems not that straight-forward. Of course, you can pour a ton of other terms and jargons to them such as &ldquo;clusters&rdquo;, &ldquo;servers&rdquo;, &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo;, etc. But they might wonder: what the heck is &ldquo;server&rdquo; ? what the heck is &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; ? They have no way of understanding what &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; means without some level of computer science knowledge or even industry experience. They might joke by asking: &ldquo;apparently in your cloud business work, you would not deal with infrastructure like a fire hydrant, right ?&rdquo; So that is weird, but valid and realistic.</p><p>And I even believe that this is a general issue happening to all of us not limited to professionals and of course general public like my parents. I&rsquo;m having a hard time to understand the recently-released cloud native platform <a href=https://dapr.io/>Dapr</a> even though I&rsquo;m dealing with cloud infrastructure every single day. In all, every technology was born with some innovations that might establish on the basis of some abstraction, which reduces more hassles for users; however, that inevitably leads to a dilemma of introducing longer learning curves for the users and general public.</p><p>Is there a way to fill this gap ? I think so. By thinking of &ldquo;fire hydrant&rdquo;, I believe the key is taking analogies from physical world to those abstractions. As a matter of fact, I have a long-existing habit of coming up with an analogous object in physical world to some technology term that I try to understand or teach to some audience. It is not only for fun, but also really casting the understanding deeply into your memory, which I believe is more strong in your brain since it might be closer to the memory of one of your understanding on a counterpart in physical world. And more importantly, that kind of learning makes you HAPPY.</p><p>So I decided to take on a journey (blog series &ldquo;<a href=https://b1tank.github.io/tags/nothing-but-cloud/>Nothing but cloud</a>"[不知所"云&rdquo;]) to &ldquo;translate&rdquo; cloud business into physical terms by taking analogies. I&rsquo;m really passionate about making general audience like my parents and family well educated, and I think I have the ability and tendency to make it work with my special background in both physical engineering and digital world. Cloud is fast-evolving and complex, but it is the future of computing. So I believe this is gonna be somewhat meaningful, both to the audience of my blog and myself (helping grasp more technologies).</p><h2 id=what-im-gonna-make-for-everyone-to-use>What I&rsquo;m gonna make (for everyone to use)</h2><p>I have been reading the book <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovators_(book)>The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution</a> since the time of New Year&rsquo;s day in 2021, which is part of my not-that-serious New Year Resolution. By this moment, I just finished reading the feud stories of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and how Evan Williams crafted the ground-breaking Blogger. Here are my thoughts and takeaways from those fun histories.</p><p>I feel myself more like being as passinate about making user-friendly product as Jobs than like being as tech-savvy in terms of making sophisticated software (like Microsoft BASIC compiler) as Gates. I&rsquo;ve always been seeking my own passion, and I found myself tend to be more easily agitated by suffering from some ugly and hard-to-use products including software, hardware or any stuff than by not being able to solving a hard problem or conprehending a complex algorithm. Although I&rsquo;m still a software engineer and love coding, I&rsquo;m not a fan of coding complexity but really into making awesome product to attract users. Plus I&rsquo;m not as intelligent as those top geeks like Gates. However, I think I&rsquo;m systematic, user-centric minded, and sharing the similar interest in the simplistic arts that Jobs put into Apple products. I have yet to get much time to devote myself to making side projects like other colleagues, but I have got tons of ideas and really eager to turn them into code and ship it to the market for examination. So one of my next ambitious pursuit is literally gonna be making a product that everyone loves to use, just like that Evan created Blogger as a no-brainer blogging platform. (I have already started to code the project, which I might reveal it gradually in my future posts - stay tuned!)</p></main></div><hr><div class=footer><span>Copyright &copy; 2021 <a href=https://github.com/b1tank target=_blank>b1tank</a></span>
