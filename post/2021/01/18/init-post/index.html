        <p>Finally, I got my first post here, after witnessing Warriors' stunning comebacks against 2 LA championship calibre contenders (today marks the MLK day&rsquo;s showdown between <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenCurry30">@StephenCurry30</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/KingJames">@KingJames</a>) and scrapping through a whole bunch of hassles for building this <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>-powered blog.</p>
<p>I have already thought of jotting down that Steph&rsquo;s quote <em><strong>&ldquo;You try to just continue to stay humble and stay in the moment. That&rsquo;s the best way to approach it&rdquo;</strong></em> after the vintage Warriors' comeback against the Clippers on Jan 8, 2021. Interestingly, it is now noted in this post after I procrastinated until a second epic masterpiece against the other LA squad. It means a lot to me as a Curry&rsquo;s fan from many angles:</p>
<ul>
<li>never-quit mindset (no lead is safe when the other team is led by Steph)</li>
<li>team collaboration is the key (Steph is Stephless, but no game can be won without teammates' help)</li>
<li>big comebacks and wins are good, but be humble and move on (I view <strong>being humble</strong> as Steph&rsquo;s personal brand, and maybe what&rsquo;s why one of his nickname is &ldquo;babyface assassin&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
<p>So somehow the impulse of starting this blog comes from the underdog Warriors' great battles led by the underdog legend Steph. I&rsquo;m still at an early career stage, but I feel like myself having a little motivation of do something meaningful, maybe just for my own notes of tech stuff and thoughts or even for inspiring someone else by my own experience. No matter what purpose it has, it has to start from some day and grow day by day. So maybe this day is a right day, because it showed me that Warriors and Steph managed to pull off those upsets by cumulative efforts rather than by one shot.</p>
<p>Just before publishing this post, I got a feature request from my wife - who responded with &ldquo;I can mark the first <strong>Like</strong> on your blog&rdquo; to my family announcement of writing my init post. At this point, getting my post liked is not enabled unfortunately, but luckily it seems there is some extra push to get my blog rolling.</p>
